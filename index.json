If you can\u0026rsquo;t find what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, feel free to use our search feature!\nHow often can I change my username? You can change your username as frequently as you\u0026rsquo;d like. We have no restrictions on this, so do know that it may be possible for someone to \u0026ldquo;snipe\u0026rdquo; your previous username once you change it!\nYou may also notice that some usernames are not available, also. We do have a denylist of usernames that aren\u0026rsquo;t available should we see if they\u0026rsquo;ll conflict with our systems, or too similar to another user.\nWe plan on improving this in the future and set a \u0026ldquo;30 day lock\u0026rdquo; on all previous usernames, though this is currently not in affect.\nHow do I become \u0026ldquo;Verified\u0026rdquo;? Is there a process? As of right now, no. Only users we personally vouch for and bring onboard for things like being a Brand Ambassador or completed work with us get verified status.\nWe plan on expanding this in the future, but there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much thought put into it yet. If you have ideas, please, share them on our Discord.\nWill Mystl.ink ever have a paid tier? This is a hard one to answer, to be honest. So right now, Mystl.ink is a free service, with 0 features locked behind paywalls. The only way to give us money is to support us on Ko-Fi (which we really appreciate!!).\nWith that being said, if we blow up and have 100k users tomorrow, our servers will keel over and die before we get a chance to do anything.\nThe founders have put thought into this, and we think potentially should we ever need to do something to raise funds is that we\u0026rsquo;ll add super exclusive features for certain people such as remove branding, fully custom URLs, and even services like web hosting. Right now, this really isn\u0026rsquo;t important as we\u0026rsquo;re happy to foot the bill for the people.\nThe most important thing to remember is that we like to think of ourselves as a \u0026ldquo;For the people\u0026rdquo; company. We didn\u0026rsquo;t build these tools to make money, we build these tools to help the community.\n","date":"March 9, 2023","permalink":"/posts/faq/","section":"Mystl.ink Docs","summary":"Mystl.ink General FAQ Here you can find the most simple questions that people have about Mystl.","title":"General FAQ"},{"content":"Need help?
